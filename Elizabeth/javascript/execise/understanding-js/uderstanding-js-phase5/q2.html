     * 2. Matchstick Houses
 This challenge will help you interpret mathematical relationships both algebraically and geometrically.

 Matchstick Houses, Steps 1, 2 and 3

 Create a function that takes a number (step) as an argument and returns the number of matchsticks in that step. See step 1, 2 and 3 in the image above.

 Examples
 matchHouses(1) ➞ 6

 matchHouses(4) ➞ 21

 matchHouses(87) ➞ 436
 Notes
 Step 0 returns 0 matchsticks.
 The input (step) will always be a non-negative integer.
T hink of the input (step) as the total number of houses that have been connected together.

            return 0;
        }
        return 5*numberOfHouses + 1;
    }
