             Century Crisis
            Scientists have discovered that in four decades, the world will EXPLODE! 
            It will also take three decades to make a spaceship to travel to a
             new planet that can hold the entire world population.

            You must calculate the number of people there will be in three decades from now.

            The variable population is the world population now.
            Assume that every month, someone gives birth to more people n.
            Return the number of people there will be when the spaceship is complete.

            Examples
            futurePeople(256, 2) ➞ 976

            futurePeople(3248, 6) ➞ 5408

            futurePeople(5240, 3) ➞ 6320
            Notes
            Humanity's fate lies in your calculation.
