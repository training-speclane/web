           Four Passengers and a Driver
        A typical car can hold four passengers and one driver,
        allowing five people to travel around. Given n number of people,
        return how many cars are needed to seat everyone comfortably.

        Examples
        carsNeeded(5) ➞ 1

        carsNeeded(11) ➞ 3

        carsNeeded(0) ➞ 0
        Notes
        It's likely there will be a few people left over and some cars won't be filled to max capacity.
