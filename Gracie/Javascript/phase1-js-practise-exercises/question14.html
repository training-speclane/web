              Solve the farmer's problem
                In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how 
                many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

                chickens = 2 legs
                cows = 4 legs
                pigs = 4 legs
                The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. 
                You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

                Examples
                animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

                animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

                animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
                Notes
                Don't forget to return the result.
                The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).
                Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and 
                not the total number of animals.


            **/

          function farmer(chickens, cows , pigs){
          const totalNumberOfAnimals = 
          chickenLegs = 2 ;
          cowLegs = 4; 
          pigLegs = 4 ;
          const totalNumberOfLegs = 10 * totalNumberOfAnimals
          return  totalNumberOfLegs ;
        
          }
          
          const results = farmer();
          document.getElementById("results-area").innerHTML = results;
