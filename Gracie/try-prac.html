 /*Write a Javascript function to determine loan qualification amount
    Write a function to determine if an applicant qualifies for a loan from a bank called "Iron Bank of braavos".
     Applicant should enter their credit score in a text input. 
      If the applicant's  credit score is less than 300, they don't qualify. 
      If their credit score is greater than 800, they qualify for 50,000 USD.
       If their credit score is between betwwen 700-750, they qualify for 25,000 USD. 
       If their credit score is between 750-800, they qualify for 35,000 USD.
    The function should return amount the user qalifies for or return text saying "You donot qualify " 
    if they don't qualify. Note: You can display the result in a really nice looking container. 
    Make the amount they qualify for big enough and provide some text congratulating them for qualifying for a loan. 
    Something like  "Congrats !! You qalified for 35,000USD"*/
