            /*Write a function to determine if an applicant qualifies for a loan from a bank called "Iron  Bank of braavos".
                 Applicant should enter their credit score in a text input.  If the applicant's  credit score is less than 300, they don't qualify.
                 If their credit score is greater than 800, they qualify for 50,000 USD. If their credit score is between between 700-750, they qualify for 25,000 USD.
                 If their credit score is between 750-800, they qualify for 35,000 USD. The function should return amount the user qualifies for or return text saying
                "You do not qualify " if they don't qualify.
                Note: You can display the result in a really nice looking container. Make the amount they qualify for big enough and provide some text congratulating them for
                qualifying for a loan. Something  like  "Congrats !! You qualified for 35,000USD"*/
