                 /*11. Century Crisis
                        Scientists have discovered that in four decades, the world will EXPLODE! It will also take three decades to
                        make a spaceship to travel to a new planet that can hold the entire world population.

                        You must calculate the number of people there will be in three decades from now.

                        The variable population is the world population now.
                        Assume that every month, someone gives birth to more people n.
                        Return the number of people there will be when the spaceship is complete.

                        Examples
                        futurePeople(256, 2) ➞ 976

                        futurePeople(3248, 6) ➞ 5408

                        futurePeople(5240, 3) ➞ 6320
                        Notes
                        Humanity's fate lies in your calculation.*/

            function futurePopulation(population, birthRate){
                var months=3*12;
                var futurePopulation= population;

                for (var i =0; i < months; i++){
                    futurePopulation +=birthRate;
                }
                 return futurePopulation;

            //OR
            function numberOfPeople(population, monthlyBirths) {
                //10 years = 1 decade
                //12 months =  1 year

                const BirthIn1yr = 12 * monthlyBirths;
                const birthIn10yrs = 10 * BirthIn1yr;
