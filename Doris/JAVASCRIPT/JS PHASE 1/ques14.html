    <!-- 14. Solve the farmer's problem
In this challenge, a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species:

chickens = 2 legs
cows = 4 legs
pigs = 4 legs
The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number of legs of all the animals.

Examples
animals(2, 3, 5) ➞ 36

animals(1, 2, 3) ➞ 22

animals(5, 2, 8) ➞ 50
Notes
Don't forget to return the result.
The order of animals passed is animals(chickens, cows, pigs).
Remember that the farmer wants to know the total number of legs and not the total number of animals.
     -->
     <script>
        // this function was just adding the numbers and not counting legs
//         let chickensLegs = 2  ;
//         let cowsLegs  =  4 ;
//         let pigsLegs  = 4 ;

// function countAnimalLegs(chickens,cows,pigs){
//     const totalLegsCounted = chickens+cows+pigs;
//     return totalLegsCounted;
// }
// const results = countAnimalLegs(1,2,3);
// document.getElementById("result-area").innerHTML = results;


//this is the correct function that can help the farmer solve his problem.

        let chickensLegs = 2  ;
        let cowsLegs  =  4 ;
        let pigsLegs  = 4 ;

function countAnimalLegs(chickens,cows,pigs){
    const totalLegsCounted = (chickens*2)+ (cows*4)  + (pigs*4);
    return totalLegsCounted;
}
const results = countAnimalLegs(5,2,8);
document.getElementById("result-area").innerHTML = results;
