    <!-- 12. Basic Variable Assignment
A student learning JavaScript was trying to make a function. His code should concatenate a passed string name with string "Spec" and store it in a variable called result. He needs your help to fix this code.

Examples
nameString("James") ➞ "Jamesspec"

nameString("Matt") ➞ "MattSpec"

nameString("javaScript") ➞ "javaScriptSpec"
Notes
Don't forget to return the result. -->
<script>
    // function above is not correct 
    //because the name has been defined as james, 
    //it wont take other names since it was define as a constance
    // function joinnames(){
    //     const names = "James"+"Spec"
    //     return names
    // }
    // const results = joinnames("Jamesspec");
    // document.getElementById("resultarea").innerHTML = results


    // the function below is the right one based on the question asked
    function concatenateString(name){

        const combinedNames= name +"spec"
         return combinedNames;
    }
    const results = concatenateString("Scrit");
    document.getElementById("resultarea").innerHTML = results
</script>
    
</body>
